# text-editor

In this Project, I'm going to create rich text editor using React Draft WYSIWYG package. Using this library we can easily create a great text editor with only a few lines of code. This text editor provides a lot of features such as text decorations, font styles, formats, size, text colour, emojis, lists also you can upload an image or embed any link.
